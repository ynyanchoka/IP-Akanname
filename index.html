                <p>The Akan are a meta-ethnicity living primarily in the countries of present-day Ghana and Ivory Coast.They frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born depending on the gender and the order in which they were born. These day names have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p> 
                <p>The Akans also have family names which are often taken from the father's side, but the mother's side may also be taken. This often happens when the mother only has sisters, and the name would thus be lost if nobody takes her name.</p>
